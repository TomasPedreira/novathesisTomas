  abstract       = {The advent of mobile robots in agriculture has signaled a digital transformation with new automation technologies optimize a range of labor-intensive, resources-demanding, and time-consuming agri-field operations. To that end a generally accepted technical lexicon for mobile robots is lacking as pertinent terms are often used interchangeably. This creates confusion among research and practice stakeholders. In addition, a consistent definition of planning attributes in automated agricultural operations is still missing as relevant research is sparse. In this regard, a “narrative” review was adopted (1) to provide the basic terminology over technical aspects of mobile robots used in autonomous operations and (2) assess fundamental planning aspects of mobile robots in agricultural environments. Based on the synthesized evidence from extant studies, seven planning attributes have been included: (i) high-level control-specific attributes, which include reasoning architecture, the world model, and planning level, (ii) operation-specific attributes, which include locomotion–task connection and capacity constraints, and (iii) physical robot-specific attributes, which include vehicle configuration and vehicle kinematics.},

The paper reviews opportunities present in the agricultural robotics industry, and a detailed analysis is conducted for the cotton harvesting robot industry. The review is divided into four sections: (1) general agricultural robotic operations, where we check the current robotic technologies in agriculture; (2) opportunities and advances in related robotic harvesting fields, which is focused on investigating robotic harvesting technologies; (3) status and progress in cotton harvesting robot research, which concentrates on the current research and technology development in cotton harvesting robots; and (4) challenges in commercial deployment of agricultural robots, where challenges to commercializing and using these robots are reviewed. Conclusions are drawn about cotton harvesting robot research and the potential of multipurpose robotic operations in general. The development of multipurpose robots that can do multiple operations on different crops to increase the value of the robots is discussed.

  abstract       = {While the demand for new high-tech technologies is rapidly increasing, difficulties are presented, such as aging and population decline in rural areas. In particular, autonomous mobile robots have been emerging in the agricultural field. Worldwide, huge investment is being made in the development of unmanned agricultural mobile robots; meanwhile with the development of robots, modern farms have high expectations of increased productivity. However, in the agricultural work environment, it is difficult to solve these problems with the existing mobile robot form, due to the difficulties of various environments. Typical problems are space constraints in the agricultural work environment, the high computational complexity of algorithms, and changes in the environment. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a method to design and operate a mobile robot platform that can be used in a greenhouse. We represent a robot type with two drive wheels along with four casters that can operate on path and rail. In addition, we propose a technology for a multi-AI deep learning system to operate a robot, an algorithm that can operate such a robot, and a VPN-based communication system for network and security. The proposed method is expected to increase productivity and reduce labor costs in the agricultural work environment.},

  abstract = {Mobile robot path planning refers to the design of the safely collision-free path with shortest distance and least time-consuming from the starting point to the end point by a mobile robot autonomously. In this paper, a systematic review of mobile robot path planning techniques is presented. Firstly, path planning is classified into global path planning and local path planning according to the mastery of environmental information. In the global path planning, environment modeling methods and path evaluation method are introduced. The methods of environment modeling include grid method, topology method, geometric feature method and mixed representation method. In the local path planning, we introduce the sensors commonly used in the detection environment, including laser radar and visual sensor. Next, according to the characteristics of algorithms, mobile robot path planning algorithms are divided into three categories: classical algorithms, bionic algorithms and artificial intelligence algorithms. Among the classical algorithms, we introduce the cell decomposition method, sampling based method, graph search algorithm, artificial potential field method and dynamic window method. In the algorithm based on bionics, we introduce genetic algorithm, ant colony algorithm, gray wolf algorithm, etc. in detail. In artificial intelligence algorithm, we introduce neural network algorithm and fuzzy logic. Finally, we compare the key technologies of mobile robot path planning in the form of graphs and charts based on the classification statistics of the collected literature to provide references for future research.}

  abstract = {This paper presents the rigorous study of mobile robot navigation techniques used so far. The step by step investigations of classical and reactive approaches are made here to understand the development of path planning strategies in various environmental conditions and to identify research gap. The classical approaches such as cell decomposition (CD), roadmap approach (RA), artificial potential field (APF); reactive approaches such as genetic algorithm (GA), fuzzy logic (FL), neural network (NN), firefly algorithm (FA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), ant colony optimization (ACO), bacterial foraging optimization (BFO), artificial bee colony (ABC), cuckoo search (CS), shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) and other miscellaneous algorithms (OMA) are considered for study. The navigation over static and dynamic condition is analyzed (for single and multiple robot systems) and it has been observed that the reactive approaches are more robust and perform well in all terrain when compared to classical approaches. It is also observed that the reactive approaches are used to improve the performance of the classical approaches as a hybrid algorithm. Hence, reactive approaches are more popular and widely used for path planning of mobile robot. The paper concludes with tabular data and charts comparing the frequency of individual navigational strategies which can be used for specific application in robotics.}

Although many path-planning methods have been developed, most are inappropriate for application in complex marine environments. In this study, we propose a novel path-planning algorithm, which combines the merits of quadtree representation and visibility graphs, for efficient path planning of USVs in complex marine environments. Quadtree representation reduced the computation time and memory consumption. Additionally, the wind and wave data were considered to shorten the voyage time from the departure to destination points. Furthermore, the Dijkstra algorithm was applied to the quadtree to determine the suboptimal path. We then constructed a visibility graph with path waypoints using an improved line-of-sight algorithm to perform path planning on the visibility graph. The proposed algorithm not only facilitates path planning with minimum voyage time but also maintains the USV clearance distance from the coastline. To verify the performance, the proposed algorithm was compared with other methods for South Korean case studies. Overall, the proposed algorithm was able to generate a high-quality suboptimal path for the USV within a short time span.}

A real-time collision avoidance algorithm solving the optimization problem as a minimum cost piecewise linear path search within the so-called Essential Visibility Graph (EVG) is first developed. Then, a re-planning procedure updating the EVG over a selected prediction time interval is proposed, accounting for the presence of multiple flying vehicles or movable obstacles. The use of Dubins curves allows obtaining smooth paths, compliant with flight mechanics constraints. In view of possible future applications in hybrid scenarios where both manned and unmanned aircraft share the airspace, visual flight rules compliant with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Annex II Right of Way were implemented. An extensive campaign of numerical simulations was carried out to test the effectiveness of the proposed technique by setting different operational scenarios of increasing complexity. Results show that the algorithm is always able to identify trajectories compliant with ICAO rules for avoiding collisions and assuring a minimum safety distance as well. Furthermore, the low computational burden suggests that the proposed procedure can be considered a promising approach for real-time applications.},

Although the mobility of UAVs allows for flexible deployment of networks, it introduces challenges regarding throughput, delay, cost, and energy. Therefore, path planning is an important aspect of UAV communications. Bio-inspired algorithms rely on the inspiration and principles of the biological evolution of nature to achieve robust survival techniques. However, the issues have many nonlinear constraints, which pose a number of problems such as time restrictions and high dimensionality. Recent trends tend to employ bio-inspired optimization algorithms, which are a potential method for handling difficult optimization problems, to address the issues associated with standard optimization algorithms. Focusing on these points, we investigate various bio-inspired algorithms for UAV path planning over the past decade. To the best of our knowledge, no survey on existing bio-inspired algorithms for UAV path planning has been reported in the literature. In this study, we investigate the prevailing bio-inspired algorithms extensively from the perspective of key features, working principles, advantages, and limitations. Subsequently, path planning algorithms are compared with each other in terms of their major features, characteristics, and performance factors. Furthermore, the challenges and future research trends in UAV path planning are summarized and discussed.},
